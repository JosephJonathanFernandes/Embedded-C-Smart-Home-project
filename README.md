# 🏠 Smart Home Console Simulation

A software-only Embedded C project simulating a smart home control system using a menu-driven interface. This project demonstrates core embedded systems concepts like GPIO control, password protection, simulated sensor reading, EEPROM-like file handling, and real-time state management — **without requiring any actual hardware or simulator**.
